## Chat Test

To test the chatbot functionality, you can interact with the chat interface on the main page. The chatbot is designed to answer various queries related to AIVOA, such as:

"What is AIVOA?"
"Who is Elyas Mohamed?"
"What services do you offer?"
"Can you tell me a joke?"
The chatbot will respond based on predefined answers in the database, and can also handle other basic queries about AIVOA and its services.
